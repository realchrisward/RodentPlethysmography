This Repository serves to preserve code that was generated for analysis of rodent plethysmography data for breathing including the ability to use automated scoring of video data for animal state (calm vs active).

As of 2023, the RodentPlethysmography project has been suberseded by the Breathe-Easy project which has been developed in collaboration with the laboratory of Russell Ray at Baylor College of Medicine (https://github.com/MolecularNeurobiology/Breathe_Easy). Not all features of Rodent Plethysmography have been implemented, but they are on the development road map for Breathe-Easy.
